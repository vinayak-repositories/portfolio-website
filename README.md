Understanding the CSS Code
Gradient Background
The provided CSS code creates a dynamic gradient background for an element with the class .gradient-background.

background: linear-gradient(300deg, #00bfff, #ff4c68, #ef8172);: This line defines a linear gradient with three color stops: #00bfff, #ff4c68, and #ef8172. The angle of the gradient is set to 300 degrees.
background-size: 180% 180%;: This line sets the size of the gradient to 180% in both width and height, creating a stretched and repeating effect.
animation: gradient-animation 18s ease infinite;: This line applies an animation named gradient-animation to the element. The animation lasts 18 seconds, uses an ease timing function, and repeats infinitely.
The @keyframes rule defines the gradient-animation by changing the background position over time, creating a smooth transition of the gradient.
